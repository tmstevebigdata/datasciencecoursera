Hi Steve, great to know a guru like you.
I would like to obtain a few guidance on how to reduce the ngram model in the data science capstone discussions.
It would be really great if you could give a few lines of hints or the reference resource links on how to use map-reduce in this case.

Looking fwd to hearing form you...

Thanks a million in advance...

Larry
